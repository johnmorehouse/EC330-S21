# Land-Use Restrictions

Cities also vary in the amount of land use restrictions they have. In some cities, land use restrictions are tight, meaning lots of costs and restrictions from building more housing.

  - Measured by the [Wharton Land Use Regulation Index](http://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/working-papers/a-new-measure-of-the-local-regulatory-environment-for-housing-markets-the-wharton-residential-land-use-regulatory-index/)

# Example

Suppose `\(k_1 = 2\)`, `\(k_2 =  4\)`. Also suppose `\(P^{elec}_1 = 10\)` and `\(P^{elec}_2 = 10\)`. 

- Assume `\(w_1 = 200, w_2 = 205\)` and total population is fixed at 1000.

# Example

Furthermore, let `\(e^*_j\)` be the households optimal consumption of electicity in location `\(j\)`. This is given by:

`\begin{align*}
e^*_j = \frac{\frac{1}{10}\times w_j}{P^{elec}_j}
\end{align*}`


.qa[Q2]: Compute emissions in each city and total emissions. Hint: Emissions in each city is given by:
`\begin{align*}
\text{Emis}_j = \delta_j\times e^*_j \times L^*_j
\end{align*}`

Recompute total emissions when `\(k_2 = 2\)`.

# Local Pollutants

In addition to carbon emissions, I have mentioned "other pollutants" from HHs

- We focus on emissions of `\(PM_{2.5}\)` 

  - Widely studied and regulated measure of air quality
  
  - At the helm of US air quality regulation since late 90s
  
  - Associated with detrimental health and economic outcomes such as: higher infant mortality, increased cognitive decline in seniors, reduced property values


---


# Local Pollutants

- `\(PM_{2.5}\)` is considered a _local_ pollutant because it affects those directly exposed

  - Emissions of PM2.5 from a given location can impact air quality locally, regionally, and nationally

  - [Ed and I](https://rawcdn.githack.com/johnmorehouse/Papers/4bc0512d24117cc3421facaf5c0b52c5addf7578/morehouse_rubin_feb24.pdf) estimate that 90% of particulate matter emissions from coal-power plants leave their state of origin within 48 hours

- Thus: Electricity demand in CA leads to an increase in PM from power plants in CA

  - The additional emissions also travel to other states

# So What?

So: we want to model how HH energy consumptions impacts `\(PM_{2.5}\)`

  - But we are economists and do not know how to model chemical transport! 
  
  - Luckily, we don't have to. We employ the [Intervention Model for Air Pollution](https://www.inmap.run/) (InMAP)

  - Luckily, we don't have to. We employ the [Intervention Model for Air Pollution](https://www.inmap.run/) (InMAP)
  
__InMAP__ is an "off-the-shelf" chemical transport model that maps emissions to concentration across the US 

  - Very smart -- takes local atmospheric conditions, stack height of emissions, and chemical decay into account
  
  - Very easy to use, as well. Python code already written for you to use. Just feed it your data

# Conclusion

## Takeaways

- Land-use policies that change where workers live have important implications for national carbon emissions
- Estimated the impact of relaxed land-use regulations in CA

  - Predicted national household carbon emissions fall by .6% 
  
    - Doesn't seem like much but this is equivalent to a savings of $310 million dollars annually (using Social Cost of Carbon)

What do we not do? Do you have any thoughts/comments/questions?

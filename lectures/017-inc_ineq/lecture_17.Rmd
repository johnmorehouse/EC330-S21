# Finding


- Not much of the gap is explained by ability


- Much of the gap is explained by _neighborhood effects_: e.g. what seems to matter for innovation is who you grow up around.

# Q

.qa[Q]: How do we know that it truly is neighborhood effects (e.g who you grow up near) not driving this, and __not__ just ability sorting?

  - Chetty and Coauthors isolate the causal impact of neighborhoods by analyzing the propensity to patent by a narrow technology class
  
  - Intuition: genetic ability (sorting of high skilled labor) is unlikely to vary significantly across similar technology classes.

# Last Q

OK, so: .hi[neighborhoods matter for upward mobility]. Next question: _why does this vary across cities/places?_

  - Do places with higher mobility have better schools, jobs, institutions, something else? All?

My .hi[big picture] takeaways:

  - Location matters! The geographic level at which we implement policy matters, too
  
  - Differences in structure of labor/housing market can lead to vastly different outcomes from the same policy
  
  - Public policy questions are often more nuanced than they appear on a surface level
